# Text to Image ML Model

Overview

This project is a Python-based GUI application that utilizes the Stable Diffusion model for image generation. Users can input a text prompt, and the application generates an image based on that prompt using the Stable Diffusion AI model.

Features

Simple and user-friendly interface.
Text prompt input for image generation.
Integration with the Stable Diffusion model for high-quality image creation.
Images are generated and displayed within the application.

Prerequisites

Python 3.x
tkinter
customtkinter
PIL (Python Imaging Library)
PyTorch
diffusers

Note

The application requires a valid authentication token to access the Stable Diffusion model.
Ensure you have a compatible hardware setup to run the model efficiently (preferably with a CUDA-enabled GPU).
